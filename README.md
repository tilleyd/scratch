# Scratch

A collection of random experiments using Go and Raylib.

## Usage

Each experiment is implemented as a [stage](https://github.com/tilleyd/scratch/blob/master/stages), and can be run by specifying its name:
```bash
go run ./ <stage>
```

For example, to run the [cube](https://github.com/tilleyd/scratch/blob/master/stages/cube) stage:
```bash
go run ./ cube
```
